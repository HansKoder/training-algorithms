# Algorithm Anagram

Given two strings. The task is to check whether the given strings are anagrams of each other or not. 
An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. 

For example, ***abcd*** and ***dabc*** are an anagram of each other.

**Example # 1**

```Java
// Input 
String str1 = "listen";
String str2 = "silent";

String Output = "Anagram";
```

>Explanation: All characters of 'listen' and 'silent' are the same.

**Example # 2**

```Java
// Input: 
String str1 = "gram";  
String str2 = "arm";

String Output = "Not Anagram";
```

>Explanation: All characters of 'gram' and 'arm' are not the same.
